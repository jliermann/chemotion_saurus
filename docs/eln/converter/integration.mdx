# ELN integration

The Chemotion Converter is integrated as a background process, so the normal user will not notice it.
If using a file from your inbox coming from an integrated device, you can just use the already convertered container (if a conversion is necessary / possible for this kind of file).
To do so, just drag & drop it from the inbox to the wanted field of the ELN GUI.
